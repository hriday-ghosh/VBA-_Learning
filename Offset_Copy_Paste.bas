    Sheets("Data").Select
    ' Sheets("Data") means we are referring to a sheet called "Data" in this workbook.
    ' .Select makes it the active sheet.

    Range("A2").Select
    ' "Range" means a particular cell or range of cells.
    ' Here we select cell A2.

    Range(Selection, Selection.End(xlToRight)).Select
    ' "Selection" is whatever we currently have selected (A2).
    ' "Selection.End(xlToRight)" means move to the last filled cell on the right.
    ' So this expands the selection from A2 to the last filled cell in row 2.

    Range(Selection, Selection.End(xlDown)).Select
    ' Now we start from this selection and move downward (using "xlDown"),
    ' So we select all filled cells downward to the last filled row.

    ' "Copy" copies whatever we have selected to the Clipboard.

    Sheets("Save").Select
    ' Now we select the sheet called "Save".

    ' ".Offset(1, 0)" means move 1 row downward, 0 columns to the right.
    ' So this prepares the next row for future pasting.
